1. New Structural Elements: HTML5 introduced several new semantic elements that help structure web content more meaningfully, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. These elements make it easier to describe the structure of a webpage.

2. Audio and Video Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas: The `<canvas>` element provides a JavaScript-based drawing API, allowing developers to create dynamic graphics, charts, animations, and games directly within the web page.

4. Improved Forms: HTML5 introduced various enhancements to web forms, including new input types like `<input type="date">`, `<input type="email">`, `<input type="number">`, and `<input type="range">`. It also introduced the `<datalist>` element for providing pre-defined options in input fields.

5.Local Storage: HTML5 introduced the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, persisting even after the browser is closed.

6. Web Storage: The Web Storage API includes methods for managing key-value pairs in a more efficient and structured manner than cookies.

7. Web Workers: Web Workers allow JavaScript code to run in the background, separate from the main page's execution thread. This enables multi-threaded programming in web applications.
